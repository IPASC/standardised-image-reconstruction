        Implementation of a delay and sum algorithm.

        Parameters
        ----------
        time_series_data: A 2D numpy array with the following internal array definition:
                          [detectors, time samples]
        detection_elements: A dictionary that describes the detection geometry.
                            The dictionary contains three entries:
                            ** "positions": The positions of the detection elements relative to the field of view
                            ** "orientations": The orientations of the detection elements
                            ** "sizes": The sizes of the detection elements.
        field_of_view: A 1D 6 element-long numpy array that contains the extent of the field of view in x, y and
                       z direction in the same coordinate system as the detection element positions.

        kwargs: the list of parameters for the delay and sum reconstruction includes the following parameters:
            ** 'spacing_m' the target isotropic reconstruction spacing in units of meters
            ** 'speed_of_sound_m_s' the target speed of sound in units of meters per second

            ** 'fnumber' the fnumber as described in this paper::

                    A viewpoint on delay-and-sum beamforming." Ultrasonics 111 (2021): 106309.

            ** 'signed_dmas' boolean to define whether the sign of the original DAS is retained according to::
